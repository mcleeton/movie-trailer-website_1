This README is accompanying a Project 1 submission by Michael Cleeton
for Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree course. All Python programs were generated
and tested in python 2.7.9. Html content generated was tested in Internet Explorer 11 and Chrome 43.
Internet Access is required to properly run this project.
All files of this project were originally provided by or heavily coached to me by the Python Programming Fundamentals Web Course
from Udacity with minor changes and additions made by me.

Included Files:
README.txt				#Instructions for building/using this program
media.py				#Containts the base movie class
entertainment_center.py #Contains the movie information
fresh_tomatoes.py		#Contains html/css to create the webpage content, generated in python 2.7.9

Instructions for running:
1. Ensure your machine has an up-to-date web browser(IE or Chrome works)
2. Ensure your machine has a recent build of python (all python content was tested in version 2.7.9)
2. Extract all files to the same folder
3. Build media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py in Python.
4. Run Entertainment_center.py in Python.
5. A html file of fresh_tomatoes.html should be dynamically generated in the same folder
6. If a browser window does not automatically open with the fresh_tomatoes.html,
	be sure to open it in your webbrowser of choice.
7. The page should include 6 movie posters, and dynamically resize based on how large your window is.
8. Clicking on each movie poster tile should pop-up an overlay youtube window with that movie's trailer playing.
9. Each Movie also has a rating displayed, and an IMDB link where you can get more info.
